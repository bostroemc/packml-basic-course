                This document provides a framework for a basic course on PackML. It is meant as a resource
                for instructors and aims to help harmonize courses on this topic currently being offered by 
                various technology providers.
            </p>

            <p class="para">
                The course outline covers the major points found in TR88.00.02-2015, including the PackML 
                state machine, PackML modes and PackTags.  Additional sections describing PackML's 
                overarching goals and development history should serve to motivate students.  Throughout, 
                vendors are encouraged to add content specific to their own technologies.

                            Reinforce the notion that PackML state is associated to specific machine behaviors;
                            the machine's operational behavior (and not the programmer's whim) determines what the 
                            PackML state must be.

                            After completing the chapter, students should be able to identify the
                            minimal subset of PackTags required for standard compliance. They should
                            understand how the three tag types (Command, Status and Admin) are classified
                            and used.  In this basic course, the intention is not to examine each tag in 
                            detail, but rather to give a broad overview of the type of information 
                            available.

                            second, full integration, builds PackML into the code from the ground up. Recommend

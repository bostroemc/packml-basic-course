                            The PackML state diagram is meant to represent in a broad way the
                            behaviour of a generic machine. It is meant to be more descriptive than proscriptive and, as
                            such, should not be viewed as a programatic trick. States have specific meanings. For
                            example, if

                            state, regardless of internal PLC logic (are any other messages to the contrary).

            <p class="para">
                This document provides a framework for a basic course on PackML. It is meant as a resource
                for instructors and aims to help harmonize courses on this topic currently being offered by
                various technology providers.
            </p>

            <p class="para">
                The course outline covers the major points found in ANSI/ISA-TR88.00.02-2015, including the PackML
                state machine, PackML modes and PackTags. Additional sections describing PackML's
                overarching goals and development history should serve to motivate students. Throughout,
                instructors are encouraged to add content specific to their own technologies.
            </p>

            <p class="para">
                Most of the topics covered here will be easily understood by audiences familiar discrete manufacturing
                generally.
                Other than a broad familiarity with some common programming concepts (e.g. variable, user-defined type),
                there are
                no prerequisites per se. However, this may change depending on technology-specific content added to an
                individual
                course. Instructors must assess these added prerequisites and address them on a case by case basis.

                            If the turnstile is locked, inserting a coin will transition the turnstile to the unlocked

                            the barrier forward will return it to the locked state.

                            Command tags are used to control the operation of the unit machine. Command tags include
                            unit
                            state commands which control the state transitions in the base state model. The command tags
                            also include parameters and process variables which control how the machine ope rates.
                            Command tags generally originate from the machine user or a remote system. The originator of
                            the command in this report is defined as the "requestor" or "information sender". The unit
                            machine
                            in this report is known as the "execution system".

                            Administration tags are used to describe the quality and alarm information of the unit
                            machine.
                            Administration tags include alarm parameters which describe the conditions within the base
                            state
                            model typically for production data acquisition (PDA) systems. The administration tags also
                            include
                            parameters which can describe how well the machine operates, or specific information on the
                            product quality produced by the machine. Administration tags generally originate from the
                            unit
                            machine and can be used on the HMI or a remote system.

                            Instructors: Describe the so-called "gateway" approach to PackML implementation. In
                            this approach, the states of a proprietary state manager are associated or "mapped"
                            to the PackML states. Note that this mapping may not be one-to-one. For example,
                            the proprietary state machine may have a single error state, which, depending on the
                            context, would need to be mapped to the ABORTED, STOPPED, HELD or SUSPENDED state.
                        </p>

                            In this approach, PackML acts as a kind of interface layer, with minimal impact on the
                            existing code.

                            When PackML is implemented using the gateway approach, the states of a user-defined or
                            proprietary state manager are "mapped" to the PackML states. For example, a user-defined
                            error state may, depending on the context, be associated with ABORTED, STOPPED, HELD or
                            SUSPENDED state.

                            This approach may not be feasible in all cases. Success depends to some extent on how
                            closely
                            the user-defined state machine resembles the PackML state machine. Further, when evaluating
                            whether
                            the gateway approach is suitable for a particular application, consider also the PackML
                            workflow.
                            Strictly speaking, it is not sufficient to develop a simple mapping of the states. Rather,
                            it is
                            required to map the states in such a way that the PackML workflow is followed. For example,
                            PackML state machine does not allow a transition directly from STOPPED state to HELD state.
                            Care must be taken to avoid such transitions.

                            where controller memory is limited. On the other hand, if the underlying code base does not
                            employ any state machine at all, or if internal machine states are not clearly identifiable,
                            then a
                            full reworking of the code base is warranted in most cases.

                            machine logic. Often such machines are based on a vendor-specific template, but this is not
                            a requirement.

# packml-basic-course

This document provides a framework for a basic course on PackML. It is meant as a resource
for instructors and aims to help harmonize courses on this topic currently being offered by
various technology providers.

The course outline covers the major points found in TR88.00.02-2015, including the PackML
state machine, PackML modes and PackTags.  Additional sections describing PackML's
overarching goals and development history should serve to motivate students.  Throughout,
vendors are encouraged to add content specific to their own technologies.

For more information, please contact the project's sponsor, OMAC, at www.omac.org.
